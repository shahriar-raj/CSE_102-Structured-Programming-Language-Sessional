# CSE_102-Structured-Programming-Language-Sessional
This repository contains all home and lab assignments for the CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional course, part of our Term-1, Level-1 curriculum. It applies theories from CSE 101 to problem-solving. We also learned igraphics (an OpenGL library) for animations, culminating in a term project.


<i><b>Offlines (Home Assignments):</b></i>

* Offline-1 is about 1D array
* Offline-2 is about 2D arrays and string

<i><b>Onlines (Lab Assignments):</b></i>

* Online-1 is about branching
* Online-2 is about Loops

<i><b>Term Project With igraphics:</b></i>

"Catch the Egg" is an engaging and interactive game developed as part of the CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional course during Term-1, Level-1. This project leverages the igraphics library, an OpenGL-based graphics tool designed to help students learn and implement graphical programming concepts.

In "Catch the Egg," players control a basket positioned at the bottom of the screen. Eggs fall from the top at varying speeds, and the objective is to catch as many eggs as possible without letting them hit the ground. The game becomes progressively challenging as the falling speed of the eggs increases, testing the player's reflexes and coordination.
Features of "Catch the Egg":

    Graphics and Animation: Utilizes the igraphics library to create smooth animations and visually appealing graphics.
    User Interaction: Players can move the basket left and right using keyboard inputs to catch the falling eggs.
    Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing with each egg caught.
    Increasing Difficulty: The game's difficulty ramps up as the speed and frequency of falling eggs increase over time.

About igraphics:

igraphics is a simple and powerful graphics library built on top of OpenGL, specifically designed for educational purposes. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating graphical applications, making it ideal for beginners and students learning computer graphics and animation. With igraphics, students can quickly create 2D graphics, handle user inputs, and develop interactive applications, allowing them to apply theoretical programming concepts in a fun and practical way.

This project not only reinforces programming skills but also introduces students to the basics of game development and graphical programming, providing a well-rounded learning experience.
