# CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional  
This repository hosts all **home** and **lab assignments** for the **CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional** course, a part of the **Term-1, Level-1** curriculum. The coursework builds upon the foundational theories from **CSE 101** and applies them to real-world problem-solving. Additionally, the course introduces **igraphics**, an OpenGL-based library, for creating animations, culminating in a term project.

## **Assignments Overview**

### **Offlines (Home Assignments)**
1. **Offline-1**: Focuses on **1D Arrays**.  
2. **Offline-2**: Explores **2D Arrays** and **Strings**.

### **Onlines (Lab Assignments)**  
Each lab assignment delves into key concepts of structured programming:  

1. **![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online-1-brightgreen)**: *Branching and Basic Arithmetic*  
   - **Problem 1**: Determining the intersection point of two lines.  
   - **Problem 2**: Evaluating whether a given point lies *on*, *inside*, or *outside* a circle based on its radius and center.  

2. **![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online-2-brightgreen)**: *Loops*  
   - **Problem 1**: Printing specific star patterns.  
   - **Problem 2**: Calculating the **LCM** dynamically as new numbers are added (without arrays).  

3. **![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online-3-brightgreen)**: *1D Arrays and Functions*  
   - Sorting numbers based on the number of `1s` in their binary representation, with ties resolved using factor numbers.  

4. **![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online-4-brightgreen)**: *Array, Strings, and Recursion*  
   - Identifying the presence and frequency of a substring within a given string.  

5. **![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Online-5-brightgreen)**: *Pointers and Structures*  
   - **Problem 1**: Implementing a structure to multiply and divide complex numbers.  
   - **Problem 2**: Concatenating two strings using pointers (without built-in string functions).

### **Term Project: "Catch the Egg"**

**"Catch the Egg"** is an engaging and interactive game developed as the capstone project for this course. It showcases the use of **igraphics** for graphical programming and introduces students to the basics of game development.  

#### **Key Features:**
- **Graphics and Animation**: Smooth animations and visually appealing graphics powered by the **igraphics** library.  
- **User Interaction**: Players control a basket using keyboard inputs to catch falling eggs.  
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the player's score, which increases with each successful catch.  
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The speed and frequency of falling eggs increase progressively, adding to the challenge.
