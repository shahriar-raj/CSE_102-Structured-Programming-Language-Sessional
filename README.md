# CSE_102-Structured-Programming-Language-Sessional
This repository contains all home and lab assignments for the CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional course, part of our Term-1, Level-1 curriculum. It applies theories from CSE 101 to problem-solving. We also learned igraphics (an OpenGL library) for animations, culminating in a term project.
